Just a simple weather forecast. Why am I uploading this? First just to show how simple the whole thing can be. Now? Well, a few features have developed.

# ❓ Features ❓
- Geo Location. First we try to find out the city via Google (Google knows everything man!). If that did not work then it is taken from ipinfo.io. The city that ipinfo returns is rarely correct (the city from the provider is returned), but the weather is not really different.
- gTTS Output. This is nothing complicated, but features don't always have to be complicated either.
